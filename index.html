  <h3 style="margin:10px;">Summary</h3>
  <p style="width:500px;margin:10px;">One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.</p>

	<div class="row">
    <h2>Survival Rate by Age Group</h2>
		<div id="chart1"></div>
    <p style="width:500px;margin:10px;">
Here we can see that, proportionally, children were more likely to survive with 61% surviving. Every other age group had less than 40% survive.

    <h2>Survival Rate by Passenger Sex</h2>
		<div id="chart2"></div>
    <p style="width:500px;margin:10px;">
Here we can see that, proportionally, women were much more likely to survive with 65% surviving. Only 25% of men survived.

	<div class="row">
      <h2>Survival Rate by Passenger Sex </h2>
      <h2>& Fare Paid</h2>
		<div id="chart3"></div>
    <p style="width:500px;margin:10px;">
Here we can see that, even just visually, that for both male and female passengers that paid over $50 for fare were much more likely to survive. Only 16% of male passenegrs survived when paying less than $50 for fare, where 46% of males survived when paying $50 + for fare. This effect is even more drastic with 94% of women pay $50+ surviving.
